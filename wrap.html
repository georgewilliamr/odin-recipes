    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Serves 1</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken Breasts - 120g</li>
        <li>Red Onion - 1/2</li>
        <li>Chorizo - 25g</li>
        <li>Paprika - 1/2 tbsp</li>
        <li>Tomatoe Puree - 1 tbsp</li>
        <li>Light Soft Cheese - 30g</li>
        <li>Grated Mozzarella - 25g</li>
        <li>Tortilla Wrap - 1</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice the chicken into small chunks, approximately 1-2cm wide. Finely dice the onion and finally slice the chorizo into discs, then chop each disc into quarters.</li>
        <li>Put the onion, chorizo and chicken into a non-stick frying pan set over a medium heat. Sprinkle the paprika over the chicken and fry for around 10 mins until the onion has softened and the chicken is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato purée, then remove from the heat. Tip the mixture into a bowl with the soft cheese and mozzarella, then mix well.</li>
        <li>Heat the wrap in a microwave, then scoop the mixture into the centre of the wrap. Fold either side in and then roll it up, tucking it under as you go so it holds together nicely.</li>
        <li>Reheat the pan that you just used, then pop the wrap in, spreading the remaining bits of the mixture on top for extra crispiness! Cook for a few minutes each side over a medium heat until golden and crispy.⁣</li>
        <li>Leave to cool for 5 mins, then cut in half and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
