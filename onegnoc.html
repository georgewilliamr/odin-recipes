    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Break your chorizo ring into small chunks and start to fry in a large pan. Chop your peppers into cubes and add them to the pan, stirring them and allowing them to fry in the chorizo fat.</li>
        <li>Once the chorizo and peppers begin to cook, add your cherry tomatoes whole. Stir and continue to cook on a high heat. Slice your red chilli and garlic and add them to the pan.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, cover your gnocchi with boiling water and allow it to soak for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the gnocchi is soaking, pour the red wine vinegar into the frying pan and stir it in with the mascarpone. You should now have a creamy sauce. Add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste. Roughly chop your basil and throw that in there too.</li>
        <li>Drain your gnocchi and thoroughly mix it in to your sauce. Serve up with a sprinkling of parmesan and more fresh basil. Get stuck in, Enjoy!</li>
